# Helpdesk Ticket Simulator

A simple command-line Python tool I built to practise real-world IT helpdesk ticketing workflows.  
It lets you create support tickets, save them to a CSV file, and view them — just like basic ticketing in entry-level IT support roles.

## Why I Built This
As part of my self-taught portfolio for Level 3 IT Apprenticeships (e.g., Information Communications Technician or Technical Support).  
It shows I understand:
- Logging and categorising user issues
- Tracking priority and status
- Basic data storage (CSV)
- User-friendly menu in Python

## Features
- Add new tickets with: description, category (hardware/software/network/security), priority (low/medium/high)
- Auto-generated ticket ID and timestamp
- View all tickets in a table format
- Saves everything to `tickets.csv` so data persists between runs

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (3.8+)
2. Clone or download this repo
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the folder
4. Run:python ticket_simulator.py

5. 5. Follow the menu:
- 1 = Add ticket
- 2 = View all tickets
- 3 = Exit

## Example Output
Here's what viewing tickets looks like after adding a few:

## Tech Used
- Python 3 (standard library only: csv, datetime, os)
- No extra installs needed

## What I Learned
- File handling with CSV
- Working with dates/timestamps
- Building interactive menus
- Simulating real helpdesk processes 

Built in 2026 as portfolio work.
